## Java Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server Plugin

The **java-spring-security-oauth2-resourceserver-plugin** is a plugin to enable and configure Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server in Spring Boot Java applications.

Applying this plugin into a Spring Boot project will prepare and configure it for all those features:

1. Enables and configures Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server;
2. Configures an instance of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` following good practices for REST API applications;
3. Configures access rules for both Spring Actuator and OpenAPI endpoints; 
4. Configures an error handler for Spring Security exceptions using the Problem-Spring-Web library;
5. Generates production and test sample code so that you have a starting point for writing good integration tests for REST API protected by OAuth2 protocol;
6. Configures Docker Compose with Keycloak Authorization Server so that you can run your application locally;

Nice! You're ready for production I guess ðŸ¥³
